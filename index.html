<h1>Using WebAuthn for non-repudiation</h1>
<p>
  <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/webauthn-3/">Web Authentication</a> is designed
  for web application to authenticate their users. But what if we would hack it
  to enable third parties to verify signatures on messages and other documents?
  Such as this one:
</p>
<form id="ui">
  <p>
    <label>
      <output name="encoded"></output> data to sign
      <textarea name="data" spellcheck="false">SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==</textarea>
    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    We need to use a web application to generate an assertion. What to use as a
    <code>challenge</code>? Let‚Äôs use a domain-separated hash digest of the data
    to sign:
  </p>
  <pre>sha256(utf8("WebAuthnSig\n") || &lt;data&gt;)</pre>
  <p>
    Note that the assertion signature also signs authenticator data
    <code>adv</code>, and wraps the <code>challenge</code> in a JSON structure
    as follows, where <code>cds</code> is some client data suffix:
  </p>
  <pre>
&lt;adv&gt; || sha256(utf8('{"type":"webauthn.get","challenge":"') || base64url(challenge) || &lt;cds&gt;)</pre
  >
  <p>This leads to a short representation:</p>
  <p>
    <button name="sign">Sign</button>
    <label>
      <output name="verified"></output> signature
      <textarea name="signature" spellcheck="false">
{"adv":"SZYN5YgOjGh0NBcPZHZgW4_krrmihjLHmVzzuoMdl2MFAAAAmg","cds":"Iiwib3JpZ2luIjoiaHR0cDovL2xvY2FsaG9zdDo4MDAwIn0","sig":"4y4PiaVDHb72YXGO0tjkdFMybjHTnYhBXtsAwppafoOaeLw8iYiH_a06lE7oemfrfF26vn_iBrevj9R7EQyp5g"}</textarea
      >
    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that <code>adv</code> leaks
    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/webauthn/#authenticator-data"
      >authenticator data</a
    >
    to relying parties. Also <code>cds</code> leaks the web application‚Äôs
    origin. We could further anonymize this format by encoding hash state data
    instead of input data.
  </p>
  <p>
    But now verification is easy using the
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WebCryptoAPI/">Web Cryptography API</a> and
    the credential‚Äôs verification key:
  </p>
  <p>
    <label>
      <output name="valid"></output> verification key
      <textarea name="key" spellcheck="false">
{"kty":"EC","crv":"P-256","x":"TEyTPauGmRhxDBsF11GmcSQIjhaI1dhETIMKbzZIZMA","y":"zsIYcdMtLmu1-xT-iGn_4bC-wW1MeEM4cJuAWPr72KQ"}</textarea
      >
    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    Upon credential creation, the authenticator may sign a key attestation, as
    evidence of the quality of the key. Note that this is common for roaming
    (cross-platform) authenticators, not for passkeys. A certificate authority
    could validate this attestation before certifying the key:
  </p>
  <p>
    <label>
      <output>ü™™</output> Key attestation (not validated)
      <textarea name="attestation" spellcheck="false">
{"cdh":"k0cIEov08uYTzu9VwSIMuccTktTJ0o2xreMZy1k6_Bk","att":"o2NmbXRmcGFja2VkZ2F0dFN0bXSjY2FsZyZjc2lnWEYwRAIgEKO28O1frllDBVTVmt2OU_KMXySsmCsfbgW0SGkTy9ACIH4KmBQLCi5FPiZytjE82aEuFhrfY0ZtLsx1OYVEnTqWY3g1Y4FZAsAwggK8MIIBpKADAgECAgQDrfASMA0GCSqGSIb3DQEBCwUAMC4xLDAqBgNVBAMTI1l1YmljbyBVMkYgUm9vdCBDQSBTZXJpYWwgNDU3MjAwNjMxMCAXDTE0MDgwMTAwMDAwMFoYDzIwNTAwOTA0MDAwMDAwWjBtMQswCQYDVQQGEwJTRTESMBAGA1UECgwJWXViaWNvIEFCMSIwIAYDVQQLDBlBdXRoZW50aWNhdG9yIEF0dGVzdGF0aW9uMSYwJAYDVQQDDB1ZdWJpY28gVTJGIEVFIFNlcmlhbCA2MTczMDgzNDBZMBMGByqGSM49AgEGCCqGSM49AwEHA0IABBmeh5wWLbfcOe5KQqBGFqWzCf7KCS92vglI-W1ulcrkzGXNVKBZz73HybMbKx1sGER5wsBh9BiqlUtZaiwc-hejbDBqMCIGCSsGAQQBgsQKAgQVMS4zLjYuMS40LjEuNDE0ODIuMS43MBMGCysGAQQBguUcAgEBBAQDAgQwMCEGCysGAQQBguUcAQEEBBIEEPormdyeOUJXj5JKMNI8QRgwDAYDVR0TAQH_BAIwADANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQsFAAOCAQEAKOuzZ_7R2PDiievKn_bYB1fGDprlfLFyjJscOMq7vYTZI32oMawhlJ8PLfwMMWv9sXWzbmOiK7tYDq3KUoDQeYQOWh4lcmJaO_uHYDPb-yKpack4uJzhcTWUAKElLZcCqRKT1UUZ6WDdIs6KJ-sF6355t1DAAv7ZAWtxHsmtdFAb2RTLvo7ZVxKBt09E6wd85h7LBquFqXJVJn7o45gr9D8Msho4LSNeueTObbKYxAVCUEAjKyth4QzXDGIVvAO36UBxtw4S0cR_lmVaLvmdTOVafxtLH_kU7hNtnmEgRxSIZGmIgEQxFmU4ibhkhtnJyf-8k4VFNWmzRXRLjKC0N2hhdXRoRGF0YVjESZYN5YgOjGh0NBcPZHZgW4_krrmihjLHmVzzuoMdl2NFAAAAmformdyeOUJXj5JKMNI8QRgAQBMcUzCBtQ0mUCpM2xpzlnGzGcQ51LxfnncFoqFEle1Q0TF1ZT7won_NN0K_vRGWeG2AesL_FDh_Gk90s_1Ay3elAQIDJiABIVggTEyTPauGmRhxDBsF11GmcSQIjhaI1dhETIMKbzZIZMAiWCDOwhhx0y0ua7X7FP6Iaf_hsL7BbUx4Qzhwm4BY-vvYpA"}</textarea

    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    The signer just needs access to their authenticator, to the web application,
    and to their credential:
  </p>
  <p>
    <button name="create">Create</button>
    <label>
      <output>üñãÔ∏è</output> Credential
      <textarea
        name="id"
        spellcheck="false"
        placeholder="ExxTMIG1DSZQKkzbGnOWcbMZxDnUvF+edwWioUSV7VDRMXVlPvCif803Qr+9EZZ4bYB6wv8UOH8aT3Sz/UDLdw=="
      ></textarea>
    </label>
  </p>
  <p>
    In case the web application is not anymore available at the origin, the
    signer would need to either use the
    <a
      href="https://fidoalliance.org/specs/fido-v2.0-ps-20190130/fido-client-to-authenticator-protocol-v2.0-ps-20190130.html"
      >Client to Authenticator Protocol</a
    >
    directly with the same authenticator and credential, or make the original
    web application available to their browser at the same origin.
  </p>
  <p>
    Again, this is a hack. The user experience is not great. If you want
    non-repudiation, use a qualified signature creation device instead.
